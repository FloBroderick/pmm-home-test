# Site Selection take-home test

## Introduction

This take-home test will allow you to create a site selection dashboard in CARTO Builder, one of the core components of the CARTO platform. In this example you need to put yourself in the shoes of a Retailer in the Madrid area, trying to find prime locations to locate a new restaurant. You will look at the density of eating places from a POI ("Points Of Interest") dataset, rental prices from a Real Estate dataset, demographics and proximity to metro lines and stations.

Your final delivery will be the dashboard itself and a blog post (of between 600 and 800 words) where you will explain the use case behind the dashboard and the methodology you used to locate one (or several) good spots to open a new restaurant.

## Script

We will run you through a script that will help you build such a dashboard. The script is not comprehensive in certain sections, deliberately :) Please refer to [CARTO's Help Center](https://carto.com/help/) if you need additional guidance.

The script is just a guide, so feel free to make your own adjustments or bring in additional data sets that can help you tell the story of how Location Intelligence and CARTO's product is applicable to this use case. 

### Import the data sets into your CARTO account

The first step is to import the required data sets into your CARTO account. You will have been given a trial CARTO account as part of the hiring process.

There are 5 datasets you need to import:

1. [pmm_madrid_demographics.csv](https://github.com/CartoDB/pmm-home-test/blob/master/datasets/pmm_madrid_demographics.csv?raw=true)
  * `cartodb_id`: Row identifier (ignore)
  * `the_geom`: Row geometry (ignore)
  * `name`: Region identifier (ignore)
  * `pop_20to24`: Total population in the region from 20 to 24 years old
  * `pop_25to29`: : Total population in the region from 25 to 29 years old
  * `pop_20to24_percent`: % population in the region from 20 to 24 years old
  * `total_pop`: Total population in the region
  * `total_pop_density`: : Total population in the region, normalized by the area

2. [pmm_madrid_metro_lines.csv](https://github.com/CartoDB/pmm-home-test/blob/master/datasets/pmm_madrid_metro_lines.csv?raw=true)
  * `cartodb_id`: Row identifier (ignore)
  * `the_geom`: Row geometry (ignore)
  * `name`: Name of the metro line

3. [pmm_madrid_metro_stops.csv](https://github.com/CartoDB/pmm-home-test/blob/master/datasets/pmm_madrid_metro_stops.csv?raw=true)
  * `cartodb_id`: Row identifier (ignore)
  * `the_geom`: Row geometry (ignore)
  * `name`: Name of the metro station
  * `line`: Name of the metro line

4. [pmm_madrid_pois.csv](https://github.com/CartoDB/pmm-home-test/blob/master/datasets/pmm_madrid_pois.csv?raw=true)
  * `cartodb_id`: Row identifier (ignore)
  * `the_geom`: Row geometry (ignore)
  * `amenity`: Type of POI
  * `name`: Name of POI

5. [pmm_madrid_real_estate.csv](https://github.com/CartoDB/pmm-home-test/blob/master/datasets/pmm_madrid_real_estate.csv?raw=true)
  * `cartodb_id`: Row identifier (ignore)
  * `the_geom`: Row geometry (ignore)
  * `name`: Region name
  * `month_rental`: Average monthly rent in the region
  * `sqm_rental`: Average monthly rent per square meter in the region

For each of them, copy the URL and use Builder's new data set dialog to get the import done:

![Import datasets](img/import.png?raw=true)

After one dataset is imported, it typically helps to preview it to verify everything looks good.

### Create the map

Create a new map with the 5 datasets that were previously uploaded.

![Create map](img/create_map.png?raw=true)

It is advisable to rename the map and the layers, for the sake of clarity.

![Rename map and layers](img/rename_map_and_layers.png?raw=true)

### Style metro layers

Now it is time to start styling the layers. We will start with the metro stations and metro lines layers, and we recommend you hide the rest of the layers while working on this.

In Builder, click on the metro stations layer and go to the `STYLE` tab. Select `By value` on the `POINT COLOR` subsection, using `line` as the column name, and pick a color scheme.

![Style metro stations](img/style_metro_stations.png?raw=true)

Repeat the same process for the metro lines layer, by Select `By value` on the `STROKE COLOR` section, using `name` as the column name, and make sure you pick the same color scheme.

![Style metro lines](img/style_metro_lines.png?raw=true)

Notice how the colors for the metro lines and the metro stations do not match. Why is that?

In order to have the same color in both layers, copy this CARTOCSS into the `STYLE` tab for the metro stations:

```css
#layer {
  marker-width: 7;
  marker-fill: #FFB927;
  marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
  marker-line-color: #FFF;
  marker-line-width: 1;
  marker-line-opacity: 1;
  marker-type: ellipse;
  marker-allow-overlap: true;
}

#layer[line='L1'] {
  marker-fill: #30a3dc;
}

#layer[line='L2'] {
  marker-fill: #cd031d;
}

#layer[line='L3'] {
  marker-fill: #ffe114;
}

#layer[line='L4'] {
  marker-fill: #944248;
}

#layer[line='L5'] {
  marker-fill: #96bf0d;
}

#layer[line='L6'] {
  marker-fill: #a0a5a7;
}

#layer[line='L7'] {
  marker-fill: #faa64a;
}

#layer[line='L8'] {
  marker-fill: #f27ca2;
}

#layer[line='L9'] {
  marker-fill: #a93094;
}

#layer[line='L10'] {
  marker-fill: #084594;
}

#layer[line='L11'] {
  marker-fill: #008b43;
}

#layer[line='L12'] {
  marker-fill: #a49a00;
}

#layer[line='L14'] {
  marker-fill: #00aa66;
}

#layer[line='R'] {
  marker-fill: #0e4a97;
}

#layer[line='ML1'] {
  marker-fill: #0066ff;
}

#layer[line='ML2'] {
  marker-fill: #892ca0;
}

#layer[line='ML3'] {
  marker-fill: #ff0000;
}
```

And use this CARTOCSS for the metro lines layer:

```css
#layer {
  line-color: #fff;
  line-width: 2;
  line-opacity: 1;
}

#layer[name='L1'] {
  line-color: #30a3dc;
}

#layer[name='L2'] {
  line-color: #cd031d;
}

#layer[name='L3'] {
  line-color: #ffe114;
}

#layer[name='L4'] {
  line-color: #944248;
}

#layer[name='L5'] {
  line-color: #96bf0d;
}

#layer[name='L6'] {
  line-color: #a0a5a7;
}

#layer[name='L7'] {
  line-color: #faa64a;
}

#layer[name='L8'] {
  line-color: #f27ca2;
}

#layer[name='L9'] {
  line-color: #a93094;
}

#layer[name='L10'] {
  line-color: #084594;
}

#layer[name='L11'] {
  line-color: #008b43;
}

#layer[name='L12'] {
  line-color: #a49a00;
}

#layer[name='L14'] {
  line-color: #00aa66;
}

#layer[name='R'] {
  line-color: #0e4a97;
}

#layer[name='ML1'] {
  line-color: #0066ff;
}

#layer[name='ML2'] {
  line-color: #892ca0;
}

#layer[name='ML3'] {
  line-color: #ff0000;
}
```

Finally, make the stations and lines clickable by adding pop-ups to both layers, using the `name` column for the metro lines layer and the `name` and `line` columns for the metro stations layer. For example:

![Metro stations pop-ups](img/popup_metro_stations.png?raw=true)

### Create catchment areas around metro stations

We are interested in studying the areas that are close to metro stations, as we try to understand their commercial potential.

Ideally, we would be interested in defining the boundaries of those areas based on whether it takes less than a 5-minute walk to get there. Because of technical limitations on the trial CARTO accounts, it is safer to use plain distance in meters. So we would approximate those areas and use 250m-radius circles ("buffers") instead.

To do that, we need to run a `Create Travel/Distance Buffers` analysis on the metro stations layer:

![Create distance buffer](img/create_buffers.png?raw=true)

Once the analysis has finished, we will drag and drop it from inside the metro stations layer so that it becomes an independent layer and we can recover the original stations. It is also a good idea to rename the new layer.

![Separate buffer layer](img/buffer_layer.png?raw=true)

Finally, let us style the layer:

![Style catchment areas](img/style_catchment_areas.png?raw=true)

### POI data

We will group the POIs into 3 categories, using CARTOCSS:

```css
#layer {
  marker-width: 4;
  marker-fill: #a6a6a6;
  marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
  marker-allow-overlap: true;
  marker-line-width: 1;
  marker-line-color: #FFF;
  marker-line-opacity: 1;
}

#layer {
  [amenity='bar'], [amenity='pub'], [amenity='nightclub'] {
    marker-width: 6;
    marker-fill: #88b6ea;
    marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
    marker-allow-overlap: true;
    marker-line-width: 1;
    marker-line-color: #FFF;
    marker-line-opacity: 1;
  }
}

#layer {
  [amenity='cafe'], [amenity='fast_food'] {
    marker-width: 6;
    marker-fill: #eac688;
    marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
    marker-allow-overlap: true;
    marker-line-width: 1;
    marker-line-color: #FFF;
    marker-line-opacity: 1;
  }
}

#layer {
  [amenity='theatre'], [amenity='cinema'], [amenity='music_venue'] {
    marker-width: 6;
    marker-fill: #88ead0;
    marker-fill-opacity: 0.9;
    marker-allow-overlap: true;
    marker-line-width: 1;
    marker-line-color: #FFF;
    marker-line-opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

Feel free to add pop-ups to this layer too.

### Real Estate

For the Real Estate layer, a simple color ramp on the `sqm_rental` column will be enough, probably using an alpha value of around `0.3`.

Feel free to add pop-ups to this layer too.

### Demographics

For this layer, a simple color ramp on the `total_pop` or `total_pop_density` column will be enough, probably using an alpha value of around `0.3` and avoid color collision with the Real Estate layer.

Feel free to add pop-ups to this layer too.

### Final touches to the map

Let us re-order the layers in a way that make sense, Probably the POIs should go first. Metro stations, lines and catchment areas should go next, leaving the demographics and Real Estate layers at the bottom.

On the demographics and Real Estate layers, we will turn regular legends on. For example:

![Regular legends](img/legends1.png?raw=true)

On the POI layer, we will manually copy the color values we used before to create a more custom layer:

![Custom legend](img/legends2.png?raw=true)

Finally, let us add a layer selector so that the final user can switch layers on and off:

![Layer selector](img/layer_selector.png?raw=true)

### Create formula widgets

There are a few indicators we may want to have at hand, like the total population on the visualized area:

![Total population](img/total_population.png?raw=true)

### Create category widgets

For instance, a POI type selector can be handy:

![POI type](img/poi_type.png?raw=true)

### Create bar chart widgets

Rent variables or demographics make good bar chart widgets:

![POI type](img/sqm_rental.png?raw=true)

### Publish the dashboard

Let us make the map available to anyone you share the public link with, and publish it:

![Publish with link](img/publish.png?raw=true)

Remember that once you publish the dashboard, if you make new changes, you will have to re-publish for the changes to be available on the public view.

## Final result

Your dashboard should look similar to this:

![Final dashboard](img/dashboard.png?raw=true)

Now play with the widgets, filter here and there and come up with a good story on how you found great spots for new restaurants. Once this is complete, please email a link to your dashboard and your blog post document to justyna@carto.com so we can evaluate your work. Happy mapping and writing!
